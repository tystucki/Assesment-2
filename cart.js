/*
    In this file, you'll be writing code to
    calculate order totals. You'll also be 
    creating customer objects.  
*/


//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*  
    Below is a cart array that has food objects
    inside. 

    Write a callback below that uses the reduce
    array method to calculate the sum of all
    the food. 
*/

const cart = [
    {
        name: 'pizza', 
        price: 9.99
    }, 
    {
        name: 'pasta', 
        price: 8.99
    }, 
    {
        name: 'salad', 
        price: 7.99
    }
]

//CODE HERE

const summedPrice = cart.reduce((total, current) => total + current.price, 0)
console.log(summedPrice)

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*  
    Write a function called `calcFinalPrice` that
    can take in `cartTotal`,`couponValue`,
    and `tax` arguments. 

    Inside the function, calculate the tax 
    on the cartTotal and add it in. Subtract
    the value of the coupon. Return the final
    number. 

    Note: the numbers passed in for `tax` will be
    decimals, for example: .06 for a 6% tax.
*/

//CODE HERE
const calcFinalPrice = (cartTotal, couponValue, tax) => {
    const totalBeforeCoupon = cartTotal * (1 + tax)
    const finalPrice = totalBeforeCoupon - couponValue

    return finalPrice
}

console.log(calcFinalPrice(summedPrice, 5, .06))


//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*  
    In this problem, you'll create a model for 
    a customer object as well as an example
    object. 

    Plan out a customer object for the cart page.
    Think about the information that a 
    restaurant would need about its customers.

    In the TEXT ANSWER area below, describe the
    properties that your customer object will have
    and why you chose those properties.

    Explain what data types each property should be
    and why you chose those data types. 

    Your object should have at least 4 properties. 
*/

/*
    Lets say that my customer owns a pizza shop
    We would need to include the properties listed below.
    -Each pizza, toppings, sauces
    -The zipcodes we deliver too.
    -If you could be alergic to the following ingridients
    -Prices
    -Local favorites

    the reason why I chose these is because its important to see the types of pizzas offered, if we deliver we need to 
    let customers know where we deliver too.
    Its important to have allergies as a property because this way we can filter if our food may cause problems
    last would be local favorites this way we can filter by the best pizzas

*/

/*
    Now, create a customer object following your own
    guidelines.
*/

//CODE HERE

const firstCustomer = {
    firstName: 'Ty',
    lastName: 'Stucki',
    address: '223 main st',
    city: 'Long Beach',
    phoneNumber: 4357729542
}
